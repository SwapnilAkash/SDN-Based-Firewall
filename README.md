# SDN-Based-Firewall
Hello Guys

We can eliminate the need for extra hardware and mangement resources for a Firewall if we can make use of SDN's inherent features for the functionalities of a firewall.

I have implemented a POX based firewall simulated in Mininet. 
I have implemented Layer 3 and Layer 4 packet-filtering firewall built in the controller of the SDN itself with user defined rules in a csv file.

The topology under consideration should be without any loops.
