# SDN-Based-Firewall
Hello Guys

This is the project that I made during my M.E course at BITS Pilani.

I have implemented a POX based firewall simulated in Mininet. 
I have implemented from Layer 2 to Layer 4 packet-filtering firewall built in the controller of the SDN itself with user defined rules in a csv file.
